Cache : It is a Temp memory, it is used between Server(App) and database.

=> This is used to reduce n/w calls if we trying to fetch same data 
   multiple times from database.

=> ** DO NOT IMPLEMENT CACHE for all modules. Select modules which are actually mostly used.
  Ex: GmailApp -> Inbox**, Sent, Drafts, ...etc

=> Cache supports 3 operations:


  a. @Cacheable: Fetch Data from DB to App store in cache
  b. @CachePut: Update Data at cache while it is updating in DB
  c. @CacheEvict:  Remove Data at cache while it is removing in DB

Syntax:
   @Cache__(value="CACHE-REG",key="#Variable").

=> Those operations are effected to selected Region. (Region is a area/memory part of Cache
   created for one module) Ex: EMP-REG, STD-REG,..etc.

*) Hibernate : 1st Level Cache(Session) and 2nd Level Cache (Session Factory Cache)

*) Spring Data JPA (Spring Boot 2.x) works on its own cache managers.
